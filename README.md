This is the core zero to hero cyber security repo , for college and beginner friendly.

Let's jump directly into the course :-

**What is Cyber Security**

Cyber security is the branch of Computer studies where do we research, analyise the digital forensics of cyber world.

Definitions :- 

**What is Computer Forensics ?**

It is a set of *methodological procedures and techniques* that help identify,gather, preserve,extract,interpret,documentm and present ecidence from computing equipment,such that any discovered evidence is acceptable during a legal & administrative proceeding.

**Objectives of Computer Forensics**

1. Identify,gather and preserve the evidence of a cybercrime.
2. Gather evidence of cyber crimes in a forensically sound manner
3. Estimate the potential impact of malicious activity on victim and assess the intent of the perpetrator.
4. Minimize the tangible and intangible losses to the organisation.
5. Protect the organization from similar incidents in the future.
6. Support the prosecution of an incident.

**Why do we need for Computer Forensics ?**

1. To ensure the overall *integrity* and *continued existence* of IT systems and network infrastructure within the organisation.
2. To extract, process,and interpret the factual evidence such that it proves the *attacker's actions in court*
3. To efficiently *track down perpetrators* from different parts of the world.
4. To protect the *organisation's financial resources* and valuable time.

**When we do use computer Forensics?**

1. *prepare for Incidents* by securing and strengthening the defence mechanism as well as closing the loopholes in security.
2. *Identify the actions* needed for incident response
3. Act against copyright & intellectual property theft misuse.
4. *Estimate* and minimize the *damage* to resources in a corporate setup
5. *Set a security parameter* and formulate security norms for ensuring forensic readiness.

**Types of Cyber Crimes** 

Cybercrime is defined as any illegal act invloving a computer device,network, its systems or its applications.

These are categorized into two types based on the line of attack

| **Internal Attack**                                                      | **External Attack**                                                                                   |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Attacker is Entrusted Person from inside the organisation                | Attacker is from outside of the organisation                                                          |
| Attacker already have authorisation to access to the network             | They are not authorised to access the n/w. They do gain unauthorised access                           |
| Attackers could be former or employees, business partners or contractors | These attackers exploit security loopholes or use social engineering techniques to infiltrate the n/w |

**Examples of Common Cyber Crimes**

1. Espionage
2. Intellectual property theft
3. Data Manipulation 
4. Trojan Horse Attack
5. SQL attack
6. Brute-force Attack
7. Phishing/Spoofing
8. Privilege Escalation Attacks
9. Denial of Service Attack (DDos)
10. Cyber Defamation 
11. Cyber terrorism 
12. Cyberwarfare

**Impact of Cyber crimes at the Organisational level** :- 

1. Loss of confidentiality,integrity and availabilty of information stored in organisational systems.
2. Theft of sensitive data.
3. sudden disruption of business activities
4. Loss of customer and stakeholder trust
5. substantial reputational damage 
6. Huge financial losses 
7. Penalties arising from the failure to comply with regulations 

Now Jump to the 2nd Modulue flow i.e **Digital Evidence** :- 

**What is Digital Evidence ?**

Any information of *probative value* that is either stored or transmitted in a digital form is called as Digital Evidence.

Digital evidence is *circumstantial* and *fragile* in nature, which makes it difficult for a forensic investigator to trace criminal activities.

What is  *Locard's Exchange principle*?

Anyone or anything,entering a crime scene takes something of the scene with them, and leaves somethings of themselves behind when they leave.


**Types of Digital Evidence**:- 

 - Volatile Data:- Data that are lost as soon as the device is powered off. eg system timeout, process to port mapping, process memory, clipboard contents, service/driver information,command history.

- Non-volatile Data:- Data that are stored on secondary storage device such as hard disks,memory cards , unallocated clusters, events logs.

The common enemy for both volatile and non volatile Digital evidence are :- **Time**

**Role of Digital Evidence** 

Digital Evidence may assist the forensic investigator in the prosecution or defense of a suspect

- Identity theft
- Malicious attacks on the computer systems themselves
- Information leakage
- Unauthorised transmission of information
- Theft of commercial secrets
- Use/abuse of the Internet 
- Production of false documents and accounts 
- Unauthorised encryption/password protection of documents
- Abuse of Systems 
- Email communication between suspects/conspirators.
